  :computer: Developer's Nostalgia
</h1>

  Note: This project became a little bigger than I've planned... I had so much fun to experiment around, learning new ways of problem solving, gaining new skills etc. that I couldn't stop. I've learned a lot and improved myself every single day I've worked on it.

  This is a little blog called "Developer's Nostalgia". This blog shows my current Html/Css/Js skills and is a bouquet of beginner projects (most of them in a pokemon theme). I chose the form of a blog to fit all these little projects to one main project. Including Games, Online Pokedexes (Main Project), Quizes etc. Since I know a lot of people who don't really know what coding actually is (& what they can do with it) and a lot of people in my generation become nostalgic when they see pokemmon I thought - maybe I can trigger this emotion and inspire them and others (younger people) and show that coding can be fun and creative. Visitors can see how cool it is creating games or things they like.

      1. As a frequent user, I want to play some games or compete with a friend (like 'PokeTacToe' or the Reaction Game)
      2. As a frequent user, I want to be informed about new or upcomming projects as this blog might getting more content or links to other projects.

- Design
  
  - Color Scheme
    - It has a lot of different colors to not bore the user with just one color scheme.
    - The color #333 is often for a nice dark but not too dark background (since dark/night mode is liked by many people nowadays).
    - Red (crimson) was used often because red/white is a typical Pokemon color combination.
    - The design is intentionally different/as less repetetive as possible.
    - Font colors are normally either #fafafa (white) or simply #000 (black) to have a contrast to the colorful of dark backgrounds.
    - Font awesome icons and buttons are dark orange to make them pop out a little and keep them visible on colorful and on dark backgrounds (and for a nice contrast).

  - Typography
    - The - Helvetica Neue - is the font family of the blog with Arial and Sans Serif as the fallback fonts in case for any reason the font isn't being imported into the site correctly. Helvetica Neue is the default font when using bootstrap. It is frequently used and recognizable and looks clean and appropriate.

  - Imagery
    - Immages are (mostly) used for a parallax effect
    - PNGs are used to display Pokemon or Pokemon Items

### Testing User Stories from User Experience (UX) Section

  - First Time Visitor Goals

    1. As a first time visitor, I want to have a good overview of the content and I want to quickly understand the main purpose of the site.

        1. When the users are entering the landing page they will be welcomed with a parallax effect and different intuitive interactions. Since the main purpouse is to show the users a variety of different things you can do with js - they will hopefully have fun interacting and discovering. 
        1. When the users are entering the main project, they're getting greeted by a little animation which reveals a short and understandable text that describes the purpose of the site (and provides them with instructions how to use the site) - also there is a button which brings the users directly to the membership section/page so they can subscribe/like etc. (secondary purpouse).
        2. The background picture of the landing page (fans will know) shows the beginning of one of the best friendships in the world:) - hopefully some users will be kicked back in time - 1997 where the journey started...right after the legendary bird "HO-OH" flew over the heads of our favorite heros:)
        4. Icons (Font Awesome) are used to make interactions quicker to understand and more intuitive. 
        5. The user is getting motivated to scroll and click around and having the best user experience I can currently give them.


    2. As a first time visitor, I want to be able to navigate easily through all the different sections/pages without any complications as simple as possible. also, I want to have more than one option to navigate.

        1. The site has been designed to be fluid and never to entrap the users. There are different options to navigate (navbar, footer, links, buttons, etc.) 
        2. If there is no navbar (in some games) then the page is getting opened in a new tab so users can simply close it or open it up for later
        3. To have a better overview there is a "Games" nav link where the user can see all games and select whichever they want.


    3.  As a first time visitor, I want to be able to navigate easily to the 'authors' social media or github accounts (subscribe/follow/like/see github repository/see other projects).

        1. There are buttons/links to my social media accounts (like facebook, twitter, pinterest, youtube) and to my github page.
        2. The "contact" section/buttons is/are easy to spot (mostly footer section)
        3. On the landing page (no real header and footer is far down) there is a trasparent button which doesn't distract the users but is always available (left bottom corner) - once they are clicking it - all buttons/links are getting revealed.


    6. As a first time visitor, I want to be entertained with some games for example.

        1. The user has a little variety of mini games - some of them (like "PokeTacToe") they can play with a friend.


    6. As a first time visitor, I want to be able to sign up for a newsletter to get more information and upcomming projects or eventually get in touch with the author.

        1. There is a box where the users can insert their email adress to stay updated or they cand simply click on the social media / github buttons/links.

    7. As a first time visitor, I want to or get inspired to start/try out coding by myself and see what I can do or which ideas I can turn into code (eventually).

        1. Seeing that there are much more (awesome) possibilities in coding than the users might have thought could inspire/motivate them to at least try it out or even develop a new passion. Building games with code could be the first (motivating) step... 


  - Returning Visitor Goals

    1. As a returning visitor, I want to play some games or compete with a friend (like 'PokeTacToe' or the Reaction Game)
        1. The games can be played over and over again also competetive. Users can always break a record or finally beat whoever is sitting in front of them.

    2. As a returning visitor, I want to get in contact with the programmer and/or follow him on social media or maybe even code with him together.
        1. There are social media/github links on every site - users can always get the contact they need.
        2. Thre is also the possibility to see the current projects of the author on GitHub.

    4. As a returning visitor, I want to be able to easily look up some necessary information about pokemon (Pokedexes).
        1. If the user needs some info/data about Pokemon they can use the Pokedexes. Either they need some basic info (Retro Pokedex) or they need some more (Pokedex 2.0).
  
    5. As a returning visitor, I want to eventually use some projects as a little help or purely for inspiration.
        1. The source code is always visible so the users can always look for some inspiration if they want to build some apps by themselves or solve one of their evetual problems for example.


  - Frequent User Goals
    
    1. As a frequent user, I want to be informed about new or upcomming projects as this blog might getting more content or links to other projects.
      1. This site might be updated with new games or features so frequent users don't get bored:)
      2. That's why it could be a motivation for some users to subscribe or visit the site more frequent.
      3. 

    5. As a frequent user, I want to be able to contact the programmer as uncomplicated and easy as possible.
      1. There is the possibility to text the author on social media.

    6. As a frequent user, I might want to use the random background generator for my own projects for example.
        1. Users can use some of the code for themselves or use the app for their needs.


## Further Testing

  - The Website was tested on Google Chrome, Internet Explorer, Microsoft Edge, and Safari browsers.
  - The website was viewed on a variety of devices such as Desktop, Laptop, iPad, iPad mini, iPhone5se, iPhone6, iPhone7, iPhone8 & iPhoneX, different Samsung/Nokia/Pixels devices
  - A lot of testing was done to ensure that all pages were linking correctly.
  - Friends, coworkers and family members were asked to review the site and documentation to point out any bugs and/or user experience issues.


## Known Bugs

  - Landing Page
    - Images size a little big - couldn't use Squoosh on them (PNGs)

  - Pokedex Version 2
    - is a little slow
    - function 'fetchMissingSprite' is not working - hours of Tutor support and days of trying didn't help. (Result: Some images in the Evoltion secton (Pokedex 2.0) don't get loaded)

  - iPhone
    - Looks good on my Chrome dev tools but on real iPhones (friends, colleagues) css behaves weird (hovers didn't work or some traslates etc.)
